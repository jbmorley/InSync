N.B.
; = ASCII 59
Semi-colons within the property section must be delimited with a backslash.

Inidividual lines are delimited with CRLF (13, 10)

Multiple lines can be 'folded' (wrapped on to two lines) by CRLF followed by a LWSP-char (leading white space).
Essentially these can be removed by doing a string replace of CRLFLWSP with LWSP.
